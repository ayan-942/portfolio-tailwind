Building this portfolio using HTML and Tailwind CSS was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of responsive design and utility-first frameworks. I focused on creating a clean, professional layout with smooth navigation and consistent styling, all without using JavaScript or external libraries. Tailwind CSS made it easy to implement custom designs quickly while maintaining full control over the visual structure. 
This project helped me sharpen my front-end skills and reinforced the value of writing semantic, accessible HTML combined with efficient, utility-based styling.
